# ESO AutoJunker

This is a version of [JunkIt Loot Manager by Circonian](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info661-CirconiansJunkItLootManager.html) that I've been working to keep up to date for my own private use. 

I'm just putting this here for a couple friends and it may have issues. It's been renamed mainly to try and avoid name collisions with versions that may be kicking around people's addon folders.

## Issues:

- I really didn't put much work at all in to the potions, poisons, or jewelrycrafting menus. They may not work properly.
- This version is currently hard-coded to work with InventoryGridViewSettings. Set `AutoJunker_Callbacks.lua line 150` to false if you don't use InventoryGridViewSettings.

## Installation

Use the "Clone or download" button to download the ZIP and place the AutoJunker folder inside your [addons directory](http://www.esoui.com/forums/faq.php?faq=install).
